              Atithi Resort and Spa embarked on its journey in the heart of
              Pokhara, Nepal, a city known for its captivating lakes and
              awe-inspiring mountain vistas. Established 2010, our resort was
              founded with a vision to offer an unparalleled blend of
              traditional Nepalese hospitality and modern luxury. From its
              inception, Atithi was guided by the timeless principle of 'अतिथि
              देवो भवः' (Guest is God), a belief deeply ingrained in Nepalese
              culture. This ethos laid the foundation for our commitment to
              providing an exceptional guest experience that goes beyond the
              ordinary. Over the years, Atithi has evolved into a sanctuary
              where nature and opulence coexist in perfect harmony. Our resort
              has undergone transformations that have redefined luxury in
              Pokhara, with each enhancement inspired by the breathtaking beauty
              that surrounds us. The stunning views of Mount Fishtail and Fewa
              Lake have not only captured the hearts of our guests but have also
              been a wellspring of inspiration for our team. As we embraced
              modern architecture and amenities, we remained unwavering in our
              dedication to preserving the serenity of our natural surroundings.
              Our commitment to ethical stewardship and community integration
              has seen us engage in numerous initiatives aimed at supporting
              local artisans, promoting sustainable practices, and contributing
              to the well-being of the communities we serve.

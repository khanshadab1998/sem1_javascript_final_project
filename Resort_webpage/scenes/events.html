                    Very welcoming the reception we received. The hotel is kept
                    very tidy by a very responsive attendance staff. Great
                    variety with the breakfast options. We also received a
                    complimentary drop off to the airport on the house! Will
                    definitely be returning when we are back in Pokhara

                    Excellent stay and the staff were exceptional, welcoming,
                    polite and very accommodating. The room had everything I
                    could have wanted and was spacious and comfortable with a
                    great view of the garden area. The meals were nicely
                    presented with plenty of variety and choice. I would stay

                    The resort was awesome! Stayed in 3 nights. No need words to
                    say how cleaning of the room. Big room with good view and
                    relaxing balcony. Very nice and helpful staffs as most of
                    hotels in Nepal. They even dropped off flower to the room
                    everyday. I met the princess of Nepal living there also.
                    Breakfast was also very optional. Love the peaceful feeling
                    in this hotel.

                    trek. I arrived very early in the day, but they kindly gave
                    me my room as early as 9h00, which was great. Very kind and
                    helpful staff. Great breakfast, beautiful scenery. Very nice

                    The resort was awesome! Stayed in 3 nights. No need words to
                    say how cleaning of the room. Big room with good view and
                    relaxing balcony. Very nice and helpful staffs as most of
                    hotels in Nepal. They even dropped off flower to the room
                    everyday. I met the princess of Nepal living there also.
                    Breakfast was also very optional. Love the peaceful feeling
                    in this hotel.
